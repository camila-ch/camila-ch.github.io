# Camila's Homepage

Hello! I have created a simple homepage to showcase some of the work I completed in a class from my 2023 autumn semester.

I used a template called ***Simplefolio***, created by **Jacobo Martinez.**  

The GitHub template repo I used can be found [here](https://github.com/cobiwave/simplefolio/).

My homepage features four projects from my web design class:

- Responsive Design
- JavaScript
- APIs
- Dynamic Website and Databases
